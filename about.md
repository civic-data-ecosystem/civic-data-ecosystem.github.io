With support from the NSFâ€™s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program this project will develop a plan to strengthen CKAN so that the software can continue to provide an effective platform for open data, open government, and open science initiatives.

In order to achieve this - the project team will work with CKAN stewards to explore several issues through this project, including:  

- Adequately supporting and managing product maintenance; 
- Integrating innovations developed by members of the ecosystem with the core product;  
- Maintaining relevance with changes to the transparency and open data landscape; and  
- Ensuring that user needs are integrated with product development road maps. 

For the next year, the team will engage members of the ecosystem in a series of activities, which will include: 

- Documenting CKAN processes and workflows; 
- Visualizing participants in the CKAN ecosystem; 
- Researching other open-source ecosystems; 
- Engaging members of the CKAN ecosystem in interviews and virtual workshops; and 
- Connecting with current and potential users in external communities of practice.
