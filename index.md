## About

With support from the NSFâ€™s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program this project will develop a plan to
strengthen CKAN so that the software can continue to provide an effective platform for open data, open government, and
open science initiatives.

In order to achieve this - the project team will work with CKAN stewards to explore several issues through this project,
including:

- Adequately supporting and managing product maintenance;
- Integrating innovations developed by members of the ecosystem with the core product;
- Maintaining relevance with changes to the transparency and open data landscape; and
- Ensuring that user needs are integrated with product development road maps.
