Recently, our team was invited by the CKAN community to provide an overview of the work we’ve been doing for the July session of CKAN Monthly Live. The presentation highlights the findings from our ecosystem interviews, analysis of CKAN instances, and Zoom workshops, as well as an interactive timeline that shows the developments made with each new CKAN release. We’re pleased to announce that the video from the session has been released and can be watched below. 

CKAN Monthly Live is a virtual forum that brings together a global audience of CKAN advocates, enthusiasts, and users to share new developments and insights about CKAN. More information on CKAN Monthly Live, including videos from previous events and details on upcoming discussions, can be found here: [https://ckan.org/events](https://ckan.org/events).

Additional details on any the topics covered by our team can be found in previous [blog posts](/all_posts.html)
