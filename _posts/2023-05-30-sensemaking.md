## Upcoming Sensemaking Workshops

Join us for a series of virtual workshops to learn more about our findings so far, share insight from your own experience and connect with other members of the CKAN ecosystem.  

### The Workshops
The project team will share findings from interviews conducted with members of the CKAN ecosystem and also use the time to gain additional insight on themes that have emerged. 

The goal of the workshops is to identify some investment opportunities that can be included in a Phase II implementation grant from the [U.S. National Science Foundation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose).

Our workshops will be organized around the following themes, or areas of investment: 

* Onboarding new contributors
* Adoption of CKAN as a data management solution
* Community building

We will also hold an Open Office Hours session to cover any other topics that you or other members of the ecosystem would like to talk about.
