Shortly after winning NYCBigApps for the second time in 2012, they decided to apply themselves fulltime and started Ontodia, becoming the first CKAN professional services partner in the Americas in 2013 – deploying data portals in Jersey City, Newark, Allegheny County, PA; Boston, San Antonio, NYC Department of Education, and UNDP among others; launching CivicDashboards at Code for America 2015, before being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/opengov-acquires-ontodia-to-add-open-sourced-data-to-its-civic-intelligence-platform/">acquired by OpenGov in 2016</a>.<br />
