Using datashades.info and dataportals.org as starting points for portal discovery, portal URLs were compiled and tested for functionality before analyzing properties related to their size, location, and age. In all, 381 of the URLs compiled provided a response to at least one test that was consistent with that of a functioning CKAN instance. Portals were found in 59 countries; they...</p-blog>
