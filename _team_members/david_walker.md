David spent many years at prestigious schools of data wizardry, where he studied the mathematics of information, handcrafted memexes, took a couple of classes in data ninjutsu for fun, and developed a particular fondness for sporks. He can also hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. He has 16 published journal articles (his Erd≈ës number is 4), and he has 2 offspring.
David enjoys whiteboards, pizza, writing text adventures (like this), developing crazy ideas, puzzle hunts, Python, command lines, solving data mysteries, coming up with names for new GitHub repositories, and sheltering in place.
