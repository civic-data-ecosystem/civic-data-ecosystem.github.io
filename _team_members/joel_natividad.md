Working on data portals & data infrastructure since 2010, Joel and co-founder Sami Baig started their journey even before that – collaborating on deploying best-of-breed, open source solutions since 2000 at Fortune 100 companies around the world.  
Shortly after winning NYCBigApps for the second time in 2012, they decided to apply themselves fulltime and started Ontodia, becoming the first CKAN professional services partner in the Americas in 2013 – deploying data portals in Jersey City, Newark, Allegheny County, PA; Boston, San Antonio, NYC Department of Education, and UNDP among others; launching CivicDashboards at Code for America 2015, before being acquired by OpenGov in 2016.  
Since then, they’ve helped deploy data portals at ~50 agencies, at different levels of government around the US, while actively contributing/sponsoring core CKAN development and staying active in the community. They have also deployed data management systems in the private sector – from hedge funds, non-profits to biotech, helping enterprises tackle and catalog their data assets.  
With datHere – they apply themselves anew to the data management challenge – building open source, data management infrastructure to ensure that your Data is Useful, Usable and Used.
