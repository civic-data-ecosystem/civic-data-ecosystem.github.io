Liz Monk currently manages community indicators and data literacy initiatives, conducts trainings on accessing and using community data, and works on smaller grant funded projects with community organizations.  
Prior to working at the University of Pittsburgh, Liz worked at a wilderness therapy camp for at risk youth, apprenticed on an organic farm on the central coast of California, ran the education progam at a Boys and Girls Club, and served as an Environmental Peace Corps Volunteer in Romania. Her experience in the Peace Corps compelled her to return to school for a more technical skill and she received her MS in Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing from the University of Pittsburgh in 2015. While completing her degree she interned with Fracktracker Alliance and worked as a GIS Analyst for Purple Land Management Company.  
Liz is married, has two children and grew up in Ithaca, NY. She moved to Pittsburgh in 2010 and currently lives in the Marshall-Shadeland neighborhood of Pittsburghâ€™s Northside (which is her favorite part of the city). In her spare time, she can be found backpacking (especially in the Dolly Sods), gardening, or exploring Pittsburgh with her family. Also, watching tv.
